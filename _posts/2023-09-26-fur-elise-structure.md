# Sections
In this post, I'm going to break down the structure of Fur Elise and talk about starting and target paces for each section.  In each section I'll discuss the start pace and target pace for each hand and both hands.

## Section A
This section is quite easy to sight read but we're going to take a disciplined approach to ensure good technique. 

- `RH` (Right Hand)
  * Start: 60
  * Target: 135
  * Intervals: 5 or 10, as long as I can play it comfortably and precisely
- `LH` (Left Hand)
  * Start: 60
  * Target: 135
  * Intervals: 5 or 10, as long as I can play it comfortably and precisely
- `BH` (Both Hands)
  * Start: 60
  * Target: 135
  * Intervals: 5 or 10, as long as I can play it comfortably and precisely
