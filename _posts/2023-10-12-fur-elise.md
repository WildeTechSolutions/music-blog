## Full song practice
Because I've learned each section, A, B, C, today I went over each of them in my 15 min (ish) session.  I start with Section B with this being the most difficult session.  Work from 100 bpm up to 135 bpm.  As the speed increases, it's easier to simply proceed on to one instance of `Section A` followed by `Section C`.  

At this point, I haven't used the sustain pedal at all when practicing this song, so as to focus on playing legato sections as smoothly as my fingers will allow.  I think the pedal is best using sparingly in this piece.
