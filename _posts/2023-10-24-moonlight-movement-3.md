Last time I worked on sections A and B incrementing from 60 BPM to 90 BPM at 5 BPM intervals.  Today, I started again at 60 BPM but felt comfortable going at 10 BPM intervals up to 90.  From there, I increased at intervals of 5 BPM up to 110 BPM.  That feels like a good break in the session at about 20 minutes and I'm not sure if I feel comfortable going much faster than that at the moment.
