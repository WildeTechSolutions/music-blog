Starting out at 60 bpm seems dreadfully slow, but it allows us to focus on the nature of the timing, the connection of our notes in our legato strides, ours rests, and our anticipation of the left hand responses.  Of note about the timing is that the each phrase starts on beat 3 or the up beat of 2.  I like to have the metronome set a 3/4 with the first beat having a different sound so my mind really understands where that beat 1 is supposed to lie.

## Rests
It's easy to forget that there are rests in the right hand at the beggining of Section A, whereas there aren't rests in portions of the latter half of Section A.  Keep this in mind.

That's it for today's post.  I'm going to stop short at a mere 60 bpm but I got my 15 minutes in for the day, partly just setting up this post.  Tomorrow we should be able to work up the pace.
