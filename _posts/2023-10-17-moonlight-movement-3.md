This song obviously pairs well with the metronome.  I start the with Sections A and B at 60 bpm.  Working up 5 bpm each time to 90 bpm.  This took about 20 minutes.  5 bpm intervals feels about right to build the memory into the fingers and work on dexterity.  

## Section B
Section B, while slow, focus on legato movement and playing left hand as soft as possible.  We need to build up the dexterity and muscle memory in the left hand.
