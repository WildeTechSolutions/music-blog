# Section A
Quickly increased speed from 65 bpm to 155 bpm.  I had some trouble around 135 on the hand over hand portion, mainly just timing - ensuring I was staying on the correct 3/4 path, but after a few plays through a 135, it became natural and I could play the whole section by memory no problem.  155 bpm feels sufficient to repeat over and over and feel very comfortable playing from memory.

# Section B
Both hands from 65 bpm to 100 bpm without much issue.  The right hand starts to become a little "sticky" at the trill and "fast section" and should be isolated around 100 bpm before coninuing with RH only. Focus on playing each finger evenly.  
Just keep repeating the fast secion at 120 bpm until it starts to feel smooth and natural.

At 135 bpm, I feel pretty comfortable with RH.  Tomorrow I should work up right hand from 110 to 135 bpm again and then add LH back in.
