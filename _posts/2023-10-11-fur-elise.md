## Section C
Increment by 10 starting at 90 bpm.  Pencilled in a finguring adjusted at the 6ths played by the RH.  Focus on cres. and dim., and note length.  

Triplets should be practiced with RH only starting at 120 bpm.

## All Sections

Played through the whole song at 135.  Pretty decent.  With metronome set at three beats I have a tendency to miss one of the D# to E pairs.  Fixed that.  Section B felt a bit fast albeit I didn't work it up at all.  I would generally suggest it gets worked up from 110 bpm or so.  Fingers felt pretty dextrous on the "fast" part.  

## Relearning
To relearn, I would focus on section B.  As the hands warm up.  Everything else should come together nicely
